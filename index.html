<h1>Who is Winnie the Pooh? </h1>
<p><strong>Winnie-the-Pooh</strong>, also called <strong>Pooh Bear</strong> and <strong>Pooh</strong>, <i>is</i> a fictional anthropomorphic teddy bear created by English author A. A. Milne. </p>
<p>The first collection of stories about the character was the book Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), and this was followed by The House at Pooh Corner (1928). Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children's verse book When We Were Very Young (1924) and many more in Now We Are Six (1927). All four volumes were illustrated by E. H. Shepard.</p>
<p>The Pooh stories have been translated into many languages, including Alexander Lenard's Latin translation, Winnie ille Pu, which was first published in 1958, and, in 1960, became the only Latin book ever to have been featured on The New York Times Best Seller list.</p>
